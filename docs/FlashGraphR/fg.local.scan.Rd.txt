_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Compute locality statistic of vertices in a graph.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fg.topK.scan(graph, order = 1, K = 1)
     
     fg.local.scan(graph, order = 1)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

   order: An integer scalar, the size of the local neighborhood for
          each vertex. Should be non-negative.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     `fg.topK.scan' finds the top K vertices with the largest locality
     statistics in a graph and computes their locality statistic.

     `fg.local.scan' computes locality statistic of each vertex in a
     graph.

     Locality statistic is defined as the number of edges in the
     neighborhood of a vertex.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A numeric vector that contains locality statistic of each vertex.
