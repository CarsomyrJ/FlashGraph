_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

no.iters: The number of iterations

 damping: The damping factor ('d' in the original p)

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This implementation computes PageRank values in the original
     PageRank paper below and does not normalize PageRank values in
     each iteration.

     To improve performance, a vertex only sends the difference of its
     PageRank value between the previous iteration and the current
     iteration to its neighbors in each iteration. If the difference is
     smaller than a threshold, a vertex does not send the difference to
     its neighbors. The algorithm converges if all vertices stop
     sending messages.

     A numeric vector that contains PageRank values of each vertex.
