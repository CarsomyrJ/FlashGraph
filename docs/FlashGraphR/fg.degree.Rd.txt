_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Get the degree of vertices in a graph.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fg.degree(graph, type = "both")
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

    type: Character string. "out" for out-degree, "in" for in-degree,
          "both" for the sum of the two. This argument is ignored for
          undirected graphs.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A numeric vector with the degree of each vertex in the graph.
