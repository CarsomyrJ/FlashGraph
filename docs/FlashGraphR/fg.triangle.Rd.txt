_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Count the number of triangles on each vertex in a graph.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fg.triangles(graph, type = "cycle")
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

    type: The type of triangles. It is ignored for undirected graphs.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Triangle counting works for both directed and undirected graphs.
     For directed graphs, this counts the number of cycle triangles,
     shown below. A -> B ^ / | v C

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A numeric vector that contains the number of triangles associated
     with each vertex.
