Sparse matrix vector multiplication

Description:

     Multiply a sparse matrix and dense vector.

Usage:

     fg.multiply(graph, vec, transpose = FALSE)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

     vec: A numueric vector

transpose: Indicate whether or not to multiply with the transpose of
          the matrix. It is ignored by an undirected graph.

Details:

     Note that the sparse matrix is represented by a graph. A symmetric
     matrix is represented by an undirected graph and an asymmetric
     matrix is represented by a directed graph. For an asymmetric
     matrix, we can multiply the vector with the transpose of the
     matrix without really transposing the matrix. Right now it only
     supports multiplication on the adjacency matrix of the graph.

Value:

     A numeric vector
