_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Spectral clustering partitions an undirected graph into k groups
     based on eigenvectors of the matrix that represents the undirected
     graph. Users can use the adjacency matrix (A), Laplacian matrix (L
     = D - A) or normalized Laplacian matrix (nL = I - D^(-1/2) * A *
     D^(-1/2)) for spectral clustering. It first computes the
     user-specified number of eigenvectors on one of the matrices and
     run KMeans clustering on eigenvectors.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fg.spectral.clusters(fg, k, which = "adj", num.eigen = 5,
       which.eigen = "LM")
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      fg: The FlashGraphR object of the undirected graph.

       k: The number of clusters.

num.eigen: The number of eigenvectors used by KMeans for clustering.

which.eigen: Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to use for clustering.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A vector of integers (from '1:k') indicating the cluster to which
     each vertex belongs to.
