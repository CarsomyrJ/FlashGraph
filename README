SAFSlib is an open-source library that implements the design described
in the paper "Toward Millions of File System IOPS on Low-Cost, Commodity Hardware".
The goal of the library is to provide a filesystem-like interface
in the userspace for accessing SSD arrays. It is designed to eliminate overhead
in the block stack, especially the overhead from lock contention, without
modifying the kernel. It can achieve optimal performance of a large SSD array
in a NUMA machine.
